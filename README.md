# expose-private-data-apk
Testing if https://github.com/zznidar/expose-private-data can also be put into an .apk file.

Test passed. Any app could theoretically steal any (private, sensitive) data you have recently visited on your phone (i. e. was shown on your screen), in case your device is affected.
